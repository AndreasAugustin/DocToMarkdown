{"name":"Doctomarkdown","tagline":"Parses xml documentation to markdown","body":"DocToMarkdown\r\n=============\r\nWith this parser you are able to parse your Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio xml outputs into markdown format.\r\nThe idea is to get a readable API documentation for your project which can be easily used for your wiki project pages. For setting up the project edit the [App.config](https://github.com/AndreasAugustin/DocToMarkdown/blob/master/src/DocToMarkdown/App.config) file.\r\n \r\n--- \r\n### Requirements ###\r\n- Target framework **.Net/Mono 4.5**\r\n- This project uses **NLog** as logger. You are able to find some informations about NLog at GitHub https://github.com/NLog/NLog . Informations about the NLog.config configuration file can be found at https://github.com/nlog/nlog/wiki/Configuration-file . If you like to use another logger, just implement the ILogger and ILoggerManager interface and edit the Programm.cs. The rest will be done through dependency injection.\r\n\r\n### Start project ###\r\n- Edit the **App.config** file\r\n- If you use the library out of the build folder, just start the **DocToMarkdown.exe** in your console.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Remarks ###\r\n\r\n- Some input came from this [project](https://gist.github.com/lontivero/593fc51f1208555112e0) .\r\n- This project uses NLog as logger. You can find some informations about NLog at GitHub https://github.com/NLog/NLog .   Informations about the NLog.config configuration file can be found at https://github.com/nlog/nlog/wiki/Configuration-file  . If you like to use another logger, just implement the ILogger and ILoggerManager interface and edit the Programm.cs. The rest will be done through dependency injection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Examples ###\r\nYou are able to find examples for parsed xml files at the [DocToMarkdown wiki pages](https://github.com/AndreasAugustin/DocToMarkdown/wiki). I used the xml which have been created from this project.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Testing ###\r\n- This project uses **NUnit** *(2.6.3 License: http://www.nunit.org/nuget/license.html)* as a testing framework. You are able to find some informations about NUnit at http://www.nunit.org\r\n- As a mocking framework it uses **NSubstitute** *(1.7.2.0 BSD-Licence: http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)*. You are able to find some informations about NSubstitute at https://nsubstitute.github.io\r\n- I tested the output of this project with documentation files created with **Visual Studio** (2012 and 2013) and **Xamarin Studio** (5.5.3).\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Change log ###\r\n**0.1**\r\n- First released version (pre-alpha)\r\n- Every [recommended tag](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5ast78ax.aspx) of [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us) is supported (exception is the [*include*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9h8dy30z.aspx) tag, but this one is not part of the xml documentation)\r\n- It is possible to log messages.\r\n- GitHubFlavored markdown (gfm) and markdown are supported\r\n- It is possible to parse the href attribute of all tags to get a link to external pages\r\n- For markdown it is possible to parse the cref attribute of all tags to get a link to an anchor at the same page (Not possible yet for gfm)\r\n- It is possible to set the App.config file before starting the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Some legal stuff ##\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014, Andreas Augustin.
